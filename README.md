# hara

Hara is a core set of libraries I find that I'm using in alot of my projects. Its currently really small but hopefully will get bigger as I find more patterns that can be abstracted.

### Installation:

In project.clj, add to dependencies:

     [hara "0.3.2"]


## Usage

There is `hara.data.iotam` which is a play on clojure's atoms. It is an atom with a more powerful 'watch' function. The watch function for atoms accept four parameters: a key, the ref, the previous value and the changed value. `iotam`s accept an additional parameters: the type of operation (:reset or :swap), and if it is a swap, the function as well as the arguments to the function. Call it an atom that can be watched with more awareness.

    (use '[hara.data.iotam :only [iotam ireset! iswap!]])
    (def ai (iotam 9))

    (add-watch ai :print println)
    (iswap! ai inc)
    (ireset! ai 0)

The main 'usage' is a data structure supporting state-based manipulation of records in the form of maps. Its a useful structure to have as a global object. I use it as a general purpose store that acts as the intermediary between the database and the web presentation layer when there is a need for data to be stored in memory and acted upon in some way. The dyna can also be watched 

In the namespace hara.data.dyna

    // Constructor:
    (def arec (hara.data.dyna/new))
    (def brec (hara.data.dyna/new [{:id :1 :contents "1"} 
                                   {:id :2 :contents "2"} 
                                   {:id :3 :contents "3"}]))


The data has to be in the form of a map and has to at least contain a field named 'id' additional required keys can be set on initiatialization or automatically inferred from the data. There is an expectation that data has to be in a minimal format for basic error checking.




## TODOS:

- Fix up the readme to include more examples:
  - load/save from korma
  - search
  - update based upon a predicate
  
- Do unit tests for hara.data.dyna-rec
