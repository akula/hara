"There are a number of ways elements in an `ova` can be selected. The library uses custom syntax to provide a shorthand for element selection. We use the function `indices` in order to give an examples of how searches can be expressed. Most of the functions like `select`, `remove!`, `filter!`, `smap!`, `smap-indexed!`, and convenience macros are all built on top of the `indices` function and so can be used accordingly once the convention is understood."

[[:section {:title "by index"}]]
"The most straight-forward being the index itself, represented using a number."

[[:section {:title "by predicate"}]]
"Most of the time, predicates are used. They allow selection of any element returning a non-nil value when evaluated against the predicate. Predicates can take the form of functions, keywords or list representation."

  => [0 1]

  (indices ov '(get :a))     ;; list form, same as #(get % :a)

  => [0 1]

  (indices ov '(:a))         ;; list form, same as #(:a %)

  => [0 1])

[[:section {:title "by sets (or)"}]]
"sets can be used to compose more complex searches by acting as an `union` operator over its members"

                #(= (:v %) 2)})
  => (just [0 1 2] :in-any-order))

[[:section {:title "by vectors (and)"}]]
"vectors can be used to combine predicates for more selective filtering of elements"
