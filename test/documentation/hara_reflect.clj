 "
 [hara.reflect](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara/blob/master/src/hara/reflect.clj) is a library for jvm reflection. It is designed to be used for testing, repl based development, and blantant hacks bypassing the jvm security mechanism. The library was originally developed as a seperate library - [iroh](https://github.com/zcaudate/iroh) but has been included as part of the larger [hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara) codebase."

 [[:section {:title "Installation"}]]

  "Add to `project.clj` dependencies:

      [im.chit/hara.reflect \"{{PROJECT.version}}\"]"

 "All functionality is found contained in the `hara.reflect` namespace"

 (comment (use 'hara.reflect))

[[:section {:title "Motivation"}]]

"
When working and understanding encapsulated code, the best way is to expose everything first, then to test each piece of functionality in a controlled way. Finally only when all the pieces are known, then work out a strategy for code refactoring/rewriting.

Although private and protected keywords have their uses in java, they may also be considered functionality obsfucators. They are complete hinderences when a developer attempts do something to the code base that the previous author had not intended - one of them being to understand what is going on underneath.

If the previous author had taken shortcuts in design, those private keywords turn one of those over-protective parents that get in the way of the growth of their children. Taking inspiration from clj-wallhack, here are some primary use cases for the library:

- To explore the members of classes as well as all instances within the repl
- To be able to test methods and functions that are usually not testable, or very hard to test:
- Make hidden class members visible by providing access to private methods and fields
- Make immutable class members flexible by providing ability to change final members (So that initial states can be set up easily)
- Extract out class members into documented and executable functions (including multi-argument functions)
- Better understand jvm security and how to dodge it if needed
- Better understand the java type system as well as clojure's own interface definitions
- To make working with java fun again"

[[:chapter {:title "Querying"}]]

[[:section {:title "Basics" :tag "query-basics"}]]

"There are two different calls for querying - `query-instance` and `query-class`. They have the same listing and filtering mechanisms but they do things a little differently. Both has the same structure, given as follows:"

(comment
  (query-<command> <obj> [<option> ...]))

""

[[:subsection {:title "query-class"}]]

"Holds the java view of the Class declaration, staying true to the class and its members. It will show all methods and fields defined within a Class."

(comment
  (query-class 1 [:name])
  => '("MAX_VALUE" "MIN_VALUE" "SIZE" "TYPE" "bitCount" "byteValue" "compare" "compareTo" "decode" "doubleValue" "equals" "floatValue" "getChars" "getLong" "hashCode" "highestOneBit" "intValue" "longValue" "lowestOneBit" "new" "numberOfLeadingZeros" "numberOfTrailingZeros" "parseLong" "reverse" "reverseBytes" "rotateLeft" "rotateRight" "serialVersionUID" "shortValue" "signum" "stringSize" "toBinaryString" "toHexString" "toOctalString" "toString" "toUnsignedString" "value" "valueOf"))

[[:subsection {:title "query-instance"}]]

"Holds the runtime view of Objects and what methods could be applied to that instance. The method will also look up the inheritance tree of the instance to fill in additional functionality and therefore non-static methods of java.lang.Object will always be shown:"

(fact
  (query-instance 1 [:name])
  => '("byteValue" "clone" "compareTo" "doubleValue" "equals" "finalize" "floatValue" "getClass" "hashCode" "intValue" "longValue" "notify" "notifyAll" "shortValue" "toString" "value" "wait"))

"The reason that `static` fields and methods are not shown for the instance is that we want all the operations that can operate on an instantiated object. Static accessors and methods are strictly operations belonging to the class and so cannot operate on an instance of the class."

[[:section {:title "Usage"}]]

"Lets see how reflection is used. We will do a search for `MIN_VALUE` with a long"

(comment
  (query-class 1 ["MIN_VALUE"])
  ;;=> (#[MIN_VALUE :: <java.lang.Long> | long])
  )

"We can open up the returned result and take a look at the internals of the element itself"

(fact
  (-> (query-class 1 ["MIN_VALUE"])
      first
      :all)
  => (contains {:origins [java.lang.Long]
                :hash number?
                :delegate #(instance? java.lang.reflect.Field %)
                :name "MIN_VALUE",

                :container java.lang.Long,
                :tag :field}))

"There is a bunch of meta information regarding the reflected field. This is used for searching and filtering. We don't actually need to know too much about the internals to use it. Instead of using `first`, we can use `:#` to grab the first element in the search results:"

(def min-value (query-class 1 ["MIN_VALUE" :#]))

"Now we can use as if it is any other function:"

(fact
  (min-value Long)
  => -9223372036854775808)

[[:subsection {:title "Multiarity"}]]

"Another cool feature of `:#` is that it will automatically merge functions into one taking multiple arities and types. For instance, if `valueOf` is queried for in String, it will have 8 different types of inputs:"

(comment
  (query-class String ["valueOf" :#])
  ;;=> #[valueOf :: ([char]),
  ;;                ([java.lang.Object]),

  ;;                ([char[]]),
  ;;                ([long]),
  ;;                ([float]),
  ;;                ([int]),
  ;;                ([double])]
  )

"We can capture the method and use it with a variety of inputs:"

(def value-of (query-class String ["valueOf" :#]))

(fact
  (value-of \c)  => "c"   ; char
  (value-of 100) => "100" ; long

  (value-of arr 0 2) => "he"   ; char[], int, int
