# Welcome

### What is It?

[hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara) is a set of libraries extending `clojure.core`, a little bit like [boost](http://www.boost.org) but without the compilation time.

### Why was it made?

Apart from [clojure](http://www.clojure.org) itself, the language lacks a big, monolithic, kitchen-sink type codebase. [hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara) aims to fill that gap.

### Who is this targeting?

All JVM Clojure developers.

### When was this started?

The first pieces of the current codebase was committed in 2012. Since then, the project has grown organically based on need and interest.

### Where has it been used?

In many places. Mostly to write libraries that keep this [maintainable](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity). 

### How to begin?

That's a good question. It really depends on what is being built. There's a fair amount of documentation already so please jump in and start exploring.

### Okay, lets go!
